## Admin and Student Guide

You can log in as a student using the predefined student emails and passwords. However, if you log in as an admin, this means you either decided to check out things or actually use the site. Given the latter, please adhere to the following admin guide:

<p align="justify">
<strong>Emails and Passwords</strong>: This website uses simple validations on emails and passwords. Hence, it does not cover functionalities such as changing passwords or checking if an email actually exists. For every new student created, the default password has been set to '1234' and cannot be edited.

<strong>Adding a new Student</strong>: A new student can be added to the database in the 'Users' section. Also, student emails should end with 'stu.edu.ng'. Emails not ending with 'stu.edu.ng' will not be recognized. Consequently, results and students profile cannot be created for unrecognized emails. Lastly, do not check the 'admin box' if user is a student.

<strong>Adding a new Admin</strong>: Admin emails should not end with 'stu.edu.ng'. Also, check the 'admin box' if user is an admin. Student and admin email need not exist. They only need to be properly formatted. Furthermore, deletion is limited. What if someone checks(✔️) all records and deletes them with just a click? 🙁😐

<strong>Course Codes</strong>: Course codes should be six characters long. The first three are uppercase English letters and the rest are numbers. Furthermore, course codes number should start with the current year of a student i.e. a student in the first year (100 level) will offer courses with codes starting with '1' e.g 111, 101, etc.

<strong>Faculty and Department</strong>: These are plain text fields. Visit the Courses Section to see all sample options for faculty, departments, course codes and course description. The options are not imposed on admins 😇. Feel free to create student profile and result with your own details (users discretion advised). The table below shows typical student profiles.
